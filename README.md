# Full-Stack-Project
I built an application in React, which communicates with backend server (NODE JS) and manipulates JSON files.

In this project I built a fullstack application.
On the client side - I used React in order to create UI of a table, which has actions of: delete a row, edit a row, duplicate a row. 
In addition, the structure of the table is completely generic and columns can be added.
On the server side - I implemented all the operations by editing JSON, and in addition I connected to DB mongo in order to save the data.
The frontend communicates with the backend, sends it requests, the backend implements and sends a reply to the client with the updated data.
